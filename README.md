# Daily Cats üê±

A minimal, beautiful Flutter app that shows you a new cat every day, sends a cute notification before noon, and lets you browse the last 7 days of cats.

## Features
- Daily local notification at a random time between 6:00 AM and 11:59 AM
- Full-screen cat image viewer with swipeable 7-day archive
- Offline caching & pre-fetching
- Long-press to save cat to gallery
- Optional cat fact caption

## Getting Started

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Background services need device/emulator to test notifications.
